TL;DR: Just thought that this might be helpful to you guys.

## Summary
I'm a student from the ITCR. I thought that this might be a good idea knowing how useful the structures are, since C doesn't have any of this, this might be really useful for those projects with some teachers that demand programming in C.

## Structures in here
* Simple list
* Queue
* Stack
